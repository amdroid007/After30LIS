A simple implementation of the PONG game. You play against the Arduino. On purpose the Arduino player is a little finicky so you can win pretty easily.
  Of course, you can change some parameters like minspeed and maxspeed that will make it impossible for you to win.

This sketch uses components from the 30 days lost in space kit. No additional components are needed. See code comments for pin connections.
