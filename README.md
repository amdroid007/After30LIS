# After30LIS
A series of fun sketches on Arduino that uses components from the 30 days lost in space kit from Inventr.io. 
Your fun does not have to end after 30 days - choices are limitless! Feel free to contribute other game ideas.

Here are the games/projects we have so far:

* Tribute - its just a simple countup from 1 to 30, showing a series of bitmaps for each day (the bitmaps are also from the 30dlis course) with a surprise at the end
* Pong - a simple implementation of a single player (against the Arduino) pong game. Fastest to 20 wins - Wokwi simulation at https://wokwi.com/projects/345724871627506258
* Frogger - a fun but simple implementation of Frogger - cars come and go from both directions, push the encoder to jump to the next lane, rotate to move frogger left and right - see how many roads you can cross!  Wokwi simulation at https://wokwi.com/projects/345729589849358931
* Dino - when the Internet is down, the Dino rules the (no)net world! Here is the After30LIS version of Dino! Simulation at https://wokwi.com/projects/346178932556431954
* Snake - a simple implementation of the beloved Snake game - to extend gameplay and to keep it simple, he can go through walls and only dies if he runs into himself. See how many stars you can grab! Simulation at https://wokwi.com/projects/351054921266627159
* Flappybird - an implementation of the popular and extremely frustrating game Flappy - make the little flappy bird flap its way through the pipes - can you make it through 1? Secret - if you have difficulties tapping through, use the encoder knob to make him fly up and down for a much easier gameplay! Simulation at https://wokwi.com/projects/354155106488505345
* More to come...
