# After30LIS
A series of fun sketches on Arduino that uses components from the 30 days lost in space kit from Inventr.io. 
Your fun does not have to end after 30 days - choices are limitless! Feel free to contribute other game ideas.

Here are the games/projects we have so far:

* Tribute - its just a simple countup from 1 to 30, showing a series of bitmaps for each day (the bitmaps are also from the 30dlis course) with a surprise at the end
* Pong - a simple implementation of a single player (against the Arduino) pong game. Fastest to 20 wins
* More to come...
